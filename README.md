# Kickstarting with Excel

## Analysis of outcomes of launching a campaign based on different elements

### Purpose 

To provide a statistically reaonable prediction of outcomes of launching a compaign 

## Analysis and Challenges

The analysis is conducted on an excel sheet consisting data of 4114 campaigns launched from different vairables including years, locations, duration, and etc.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date

First part of the analysis is to analyze outcomes based on the launch dates of all the campaigns. A pivot table and pivot chart (line chart) are created showing the counts of outcomes on the column (x-axis) while 12 months on the row (y-axis). Since our friend, Louise is planning to launch a play under theater category, so "theater" is filtered in the category section in the table and chart. The chart indicates that campaigns launched under "theater" has relatively high success rate and the month with most sucess is May.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals

Second part of the analysis is to analyze outcomes based on the goals set by all the campaigns. In order to calculate the percentages in different outcomes from different "goal" ranges, additional calculation is conducted. Based on the calculation, a line chart is created showing the percentage of different outcomes on the column (x-axis) while different goal ranges on the row (y-axis).The chart indicates that different goals set by the campaigns have either positive or negative impact on the outcomes of the campaigns.

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

More filtering for example, the country where Louise is planning to launch her campaign, should be conducted before conclusion.

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?

The analysis shows that campaigns launched under "theater" has relatively high success rate and the month with most sucess is May.

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?

The analysis shows that different goals set by the campaigns have either positive or negative impact on the outcomes of the campaigns.

- What are some limitations of this dataset?

Only 4114 of records are provided, even though the data covers different elements, but the sample size should be bigger for better analysis.

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?

Pie chart and box plots showing outcomes based on other elements (such as either the campaign is staff picked or not) on the dataset can be created.
